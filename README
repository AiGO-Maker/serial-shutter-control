Serial shutter control
======================

This tool allows some automation for astrophotography with a DSLR
camera, by triggering the shutter using a control pin of a serial
port.

Usage: ssc [options] [time in seconds]

  -s  serial port to use       [default: /dev/ttyS0]
  -c  number of exposures      [default: 1]
  -t  exposure time in seconds [default: 1]
  -p  pause in seconds         [default: 5]
  -m  MLU number of pulses     [default: 2]
  -M  MLU delay in miliseconds [default: 2000]
  -S  min shutter in milisec   [default: 200]
  -d  PHD dither amount (1..5) [default: 0]
  -P  PHD host:port            [default: localhost:4300]
  -q  quiet operation
  -h  this help summary


Mirror lockup - some cameras expect one shutter press to raise the
mirror, and another to trigger the exposure, like the Canon
400D. Others, like my old Konica-Minolta 5D will start a timer when
the shutter is pressed, then expose. Use whatever is appropriate for
yours (MLU number of pulses, MLU delay).

PHD dither - If you're using PHD or OpenPHD for auto-guiding, you can
dither between exposures if you enable the PHD server. OpenPHD is here:

Interfacing - I'm using something not unlike the interface described
here: http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/dslr/CanonRelease.html

I would however suggest you use two optocouplers (or similar) rather
than connecting the focus and exposure wires directly. That has the
annoying effect that when you press the shutter halfway on the camera
(to get out of review mode, for instance), it will also trigger an
exposure.
